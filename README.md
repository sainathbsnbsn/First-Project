Portfolio Website

Welcome to my Portfolio Website repository! This project showcases a collection of my web development work, where I share a variety of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript templates. Each template is designed to help you learn and get inspired by common web development components such as login forms, navigation bars, styled cards, portfolios, and more.

Features:
- YouTube Integration: Each of my projects is linked to a YouTube video. By clicking on the YouTube thumbnails, you'll be redirected to another page where you can view the full video showcasing the code and explanation behind each template.
- Code and Resources: You'll find the full source code for each template, so you can easily replicate and customize the designs for your own projects.

Content:
On my YouTube channel, I regularly upload videos focused on web development topics like:
- HTML and CSS layout tutorials
- Responsive web design techniques
- JavaScript interactions and functionality
- And much more!

Feel free to explore, learn, and get inspired by my work. You can access the detailed explanations and view live demos by following the video links provided in this repository.

Happy coding!
